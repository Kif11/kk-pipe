    Special characters in path definition are:
	@  - Typically expands to the HOUDINI_PATH.  Thus, if the
	     HOUDINI_PATH was set to:
	        $HIP
		$HFS/houdini
		$HOME/houdini
	     a path defined as "@/vex" would expand to the paths
	        $HIP/vex
		$HFS/houdini/vex
		$HOME/houdini/vex
	=  - This expands to the $HIP variable.  This path will always
	     point to where the currently loaded hip resides.
	&  - The ampersand character expands to the "default" path.
	     For example, to add a directory to the a path without
	     worrying about what the default path should actually be,
	     simply set the path to: "/mypath;&amp;".  This will search
	     the "/mypath" path first, then search the default path.
	^  - Some paths are used for multiple directories.  For
	     example, the HOUDINI_VEX_PATH is used to define the
	     search path for Surface, Displacement, Sop, etc. VEX
	     shaders.  For VEX, the ^ symbol expands to the shader
	     type.  Thus, if the HOUDINI_VEX_PATH variable is set to
	     something like "/usr/local/vex;$HOME/vex/^", when
	     loading Surface shaders, the following directories will
	     be scanned:
		/usr/local/vex
		$HOME/vex/Surface
	     and if Sop shaders are being searched for, the
	     following paths will be searched:
		/usr/local/vex
		$HOME/vex/Sop

Common paths are set to:
$JOB = F:/python/kk_pipe
$HIP = F:/python/kk_pipe
$HOME = F:/python/kk_pipe/user_prefs
$HSITE = <not defined>
$HFS = C:/PROGRA~1/SIDEEF~1/HOUDIN~1.498

    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HFS/houdini/dso"

HOUDINI_GALLERY_PATH                      := "@/gallery"
    Specifies the search path to the directory that contains the gallery files.
    If this variable is not set, Houdini looks in the 'gallery' subdirectories
    of the standard search path, which includes $HFS/houdini/gallery/, for
    example.  Gallery files specify the predefined parameter values for any node
    type, much like the presetsd. However, they are used predominantly for
    defining shaders and materials.

    Default path: '@/gallery'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_PATH
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HFS/houdini/gallery"

    scripts is independent of GLSL searching and is controlled by the
    HOUDINI_PATH.

    Default path: '.;@/glsl'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_PATH
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "."
	2) "$HFS/houdini/glsl"

HOUDINI_IMAGE_DSO_PATH                    := "@/fb"

    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "."
	2) "$HFS/houdini/ocl"

HOUDINI_OPLIBRARIES_PATH                  := "@"
    The path of directories where Houdini looks for OPlibraries files
    for loading OTL files at startup.  OPlibraries files are only used
    if the Operator Type Manager is configured to use them. Otherwise
    OTL files are scanned for directly.  This path by default is equal
    to the HOUDINI_OTL_PATH.

    Default path: '@'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_OTL_PATH
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HIP"
	2) "$HOME/houdini13.0"
	3) "$HFS/houdini"
	4) "$HFS/bin"

HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH                      := "F:/python/kk_pipe/lib_vendor/qLib/otls/base;@/otls"
    This path specifies the directories Houdini will search for OTL files.
    This value is only used if the Operator Type Manager is configured not
    to use OPlibraries files to find OTL files. The default for this value
    is the HOUDINI_OTL_PATH with "/otls" appended to each directory in
    that path.

    Default path: '@/otls'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_OTL_PATH
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HIP/lib_vendor/qLib/otls/base"
	2) "$HOME/houdini13.0/otls"
	3) "$HFS/houdini/otls"

HOUDINI_OTL_PATH                          := "@"
    This path is not used directly by Houdini.  It is used to provide
    default values for the HOUDINI_OPLIBRARIES_PATH and HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH
    values in a way that is backward compatible (since HOUDINI_OTL_PATH
    used to mean what HOUDINI_OPLIBRARIES_PATH now means).

    Default path: '@'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_PATH
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HIP"
	2) "$HOME/houdini13.0"

	2) "C:/windows/Fonts"

HOUDINI_SCRIPT_PATH                       := "@/scripts"
    The path of directories where Houdini searches for scripts.  This
    includes .cmd files for hscript, .class files for the java command,
    .tcl and .tk files for the tcl and tk commands, and command scripts
    for the Alfred Output Driver.

    Default path: '@/scripts'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_PATH
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HOME/houdini13.0/scripts"
	2) "$HFS/houdini/scripts"

	2) "$HFS/houdini/pic"

HOUDINI_TOOLBAR_PATH                      := "@/^"
    The search path for factory and custom shelves and shelf tools (i.e., 
    shelf files). The shelf files are searched for and loaded when Houdini
    starts. They can define new tools that appear in the TAB menu or new
    groupings of tools (ie, toolbars or shelves) which can be displayed in the
    shelving area (usually, just below the main menu).

    Default path: '@/^'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_PATH
	and ^ is replaced with toolbar
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HOME/houdini13.0/toolbar"
	2) "$HFS/houdini/toolbar"

HOUDINI_UI_APP_PATH                       := "@/^"

    An application search path for the audio notification files used by the 
    interface. Use care in changing this path, otherwise audio notifcations
    may stop working.

    Default path: '@/^'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_UI_PATH
	and ^ is replaced with Audio
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HFS/houdini/config/Audio"

HOUDINI_UI_CURSOR_PATH                    := "@/^"
    An application search path for locating the Houdini mouse cursor set. Use
    care when changing this path, otherwise the mouse cursor may not reflect
    its current context.

    Default path: '@/^'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_UI_PATH
	and ^ is replaced with Cursors
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HFS/houdini/config/Cursors"

HOUDINI_UI_ICON_PATH                      := "@/^"
    The search path for icon files. Setting this path will override the
    default of $HOUDINI_PATH/config/Icons.

    Default path: '@/^'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_UI_PATH
	and ^ is replaced with Icons
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HOME/houdini13.0/config/Icons"

HOUDINI_UI_PATH                           := "@/config"
    The base path for all user interface files. Use extreme care when changing
    this variable, or graphical Houdini applications may not start. Before
    adding paths to this variable, check the other HOUDINI_UI variables to see
    if one or more of those paths will accomplish what you need. Adding a new
    path to this variable can be expensive.

    Default path: '@/config'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_PATH
    Directories searched (in order) are:
	1) "$HIP/config"
	2) "$HOME/houdini13.0/config"

    The search path for VEX code.  Setting this path will override the
    default path of $HOUDINI_PATH/vex/.  Searching for the dialog
    scripts is independent of VEX searching and is controlled by the
    HOUDINI_PATH.

    Default path: '.;@/vex/^'
	Where @ is replaced with HOUDINI_PATH
	and ^ is replaced with Displacement, Fog, Light, Shadow, Surface, Chop, Cop2, Image3d, Sop, Pop, CVex

HOUDINI_VOP_DEFINITIONS_PATH              := "@/vop"
    Defines the directory search path where Houdini looks for connector
    type definitions (such as new struct definitions). The default is to look
    in the "vop" subdirectory of HOUDINI_PATH directories.
